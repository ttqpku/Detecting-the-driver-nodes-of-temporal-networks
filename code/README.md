# Detecting the driver nodes of temporal networks

## DESCRIPTION

This is a Matlab program designed for detecting the driver nodes of temporal networks (see more details in the paper "Tingting Qin et al. Detecting the driver nodes of temporal networks, 2023 New J. Phys. 25 083031")

## FILE

--Utils.m:  a collection of functions that return the set of driver nodes in the temporal networks

--MCS_fun.m: function to derive the maximum controllable subspace for a set of driver nodes

--onlineMaxflow.m: function to carry out the solution process for the max-flow increment as shown in figure 3 in the paper

--Table_data.m: performance comparison of existing algorithms and our algorithm (OTaHa) in five empirical datasets

--Multiple_driveNodeSets.m: to obtain multiple sets of driver nodes by OTaHa

--Edge_categories.m: the m-file for figure 5

--edge_betweenness_num.m: function to calculate the number of shortest paths that pass through a given edge or node

--Random_remove.m: explore the effect of random attacks on network controllability in five empirical datasets

--edgeRemove_btw.m: explore the effect of target attacks in ascending (descending) order of edge betweenness, on network controllability in five empirical datasets
